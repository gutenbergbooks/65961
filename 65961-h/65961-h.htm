<h1>When Oscar Went Wild</h1>
<div style='text-align:center;'>by W. C. Tuttle</div>
<div style='text-align:center;font-size:smaller;margin-bottom:2em;margin-top:1em;'>Author of “Derelicts of the Hills,” “Magpie’s Nightbear.”</div>

<p>Ren Merton and Sig Watson had spent the night in Piperock and of a
consequence were in no shape to appreciate the beauties of the dewy
morn, as their horses picked their way up the trail to the top of
Overwhich ridge.</p>

<p>“Them Piperock fellers play poker like I sing,” stated Sig, as they
pulled up their mounts for a breathing spell. “They gits their words and
music so mixed that nobody knows what they’re tryin’ to do. They’re uh
success, though.”</p>

<p>Ren removed his sombrero with an exaggerated flourish and, lifting
himself in his stirrups, broke forth in a shrill falsetto:</p>

<p>“Nobode-e-e-e knows how dry I am.”</p>

<p>“Shut up!”</p>

<p>“Mama mine, he won’t let me sing,” wailed Ren. “I lost jist as much as
he did and m’ head aches jist as hard and he won’t let m’ sing. What do
yuh know about that!”</p>

<p>“Jist don’t sing, that’s all,” replied Sig. “You can say all th’ funny
things yuh wants to to yoreself, but I’m right here to remark that
singin’&mdash;yore kind uh singin’&mdash;ain’t in de-mand a-tall. <i>Sabe?</i>”</p>

<p>“Always misunderstood,” mumbled Ren. “Th’ human race ain’t never
understood me. Mother misunderstood me; father follered suit, and now
you&mdash;Siggie, my old pal&mdash;you turns on me.”</p>

<p>“Misunderstood!” Sig turned in his saddle and gazed reflectively at his
partner. “Ren Merton, if you was ever entered fer th’ human race you
shore was scratched. Yore nose ain’t right&mdash;too long. Yuh got uh bad
case uh squints in both uh yore eyes, and yore mouth, which was cut too
wide in th’ first place, ain’t shrunk none a-tall. Shoulders? Say, I
sometimes wonder how comes it that yore collar don’t slip down and trip
yuh. Also, yore right foot is where yore left ought to be.”</p>

<p>“Pickled prairie-dogs, that’s right!” agreed Ren. “I reckon I shore must
a been muddled this mawnin’ when I puts on m’ boots.”</p>

<p>“And also yore hair&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You stops at hair!” exploded Ren. “Mebby I’ve got red hair and mebby
she runs uh little to th’ rusty shade, but I’ll be danged if any feller
with fat eyebrows, buffalo-horn mustache and bow legs can taunt me with
th’ fact. Take uh look in th’ glass and you’ll see that you ain’t no
one-to-ten shot in this race yoreself, Sig.”</p>

<p>Sig grunted and turned back. The horses seemed to start by mutual
consent and plodded off down the hogback.</p>

<p>“I’ve knowed uh lot uh people,” remarked Sig, “who thought they had red
hair, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He pulled up his horse.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t that a voice, Ren?”</p>

<p>“I reckon not&mdash;not uh human one anyway. Go on and finish yore remarks
about hair.”</p>

<p>“I tell yuh I heard somebody yell!” declared Sig. “It was jist over that
ridge, and I’m goin’ to see who it was.”</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>He spurred his horse into a gallop and Ren followed at his heels. They
crossed the ridge and swung down into an open timbered swale,
interspersed with clumps of willows and jack-pines.</p>

<p>There they saw her. She was tied to a tree and seemed to be exerting
every muscle to get loose. She was dressed in a faded calico dress and
her dark-brown hair tumbled in confusion about her half-bare shoulders.</p>

<p>The sight of her was a shock to the punchers and they threw their
broncos back on their haunches at the sight. The girl didn’t see them,
and after the first gasp of surprise they sat there and stared at her.</p>

<p>Suddenly she shrank back against the tree and screamed&mdash;</p>

<p>“That’s not Oscar!”</p>

<p>Like a flash of yellow light a scared cougar had bounded out of the
willow thicket near her and crouched low.</p>

<p>Ren acted first. While he hadn’t the uncanny skill on the draw
attributed to the Western gunman, he was deadly when he did “get his ol’
smoke-wagon unhitched.” The cougar had barely touched his belly to the
ground when Ren’s .45 started to spout death and destruction.</p>

<p>Two of the heavy slugs tore through its neck, and the cougar tied itself
in a snarling, spitting knot and rolled over dead. When the last shot
was fired Ren’s horse was nearly over the body of the cougar and Ren was
shoving fresh shells into the gun.</p>

<p>The girl looked at Ren in a dazed sort of a way for a moment and then in
a tired little voice remarked&mdash;</p>

<p>“That wasn’t Oscar.”</p>

<p>“No, ma’am,” agreed Ren foolishly. “That shore wasn’t Oscar.”</p>

<p>“What happened?” asked a deep bass voice, and Ren turned in his saddle;
behind him stood a florid-faced person in a green corduroy suit and
panama, and behind him a narrow-shouldered, sharp-faced man in
knickerbockers.</p>

<p>“What happened, I asked?” repeated the florid one.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t Oscar,” stated the girl for the third time.</p>

<p>“Well, what was it, then?” queried the sharp-faced man.</p>

<p>“I kept grinding until this cowboy person butted in and spoiled it.”</p>

<p>“Did you quit then?” roared the florid one. “By Jupiter! You lost a fine
chance for some real stuff. But what happened to Oscar, and where in the
world did this other lion come from?”</p>

<p>“Did it&mdash;I say&mdash;where did it?”</p>

<p>Another person had joined the crowd. He was hatless and garbed in the
costume of the early settler, fringed and beaded buckskin from his toes
to his chin, and his face was ashen. He walked up with an uncertain
gait and his breathing gave evidence of recent exertion.</p>

<p>“What happened to you, Jack?” asked the florid one.</p>

<p>“Why, I&mdash;uh&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You met it too, did you?” grinned the thin-faced one, and the fringed
one gulped an assent.</p>

<p>“I was&mdash;er&mdash;just coming through that clump of bushes and I met it. You
see I&mdash;er&mdash;thought perhaps that if I ran I could coax it away from the
rest of you.”</p>

<p>“Haw, haw, haw!” roared Sig. “You shore ought to git uh hero medal.
Didn’t yuh know that no self-respectin’ cougar would chase uh git-up
like that?”</p>

<p>Just then two more men came running down the hill and, seeing the crowd,
one of them stopped and cupped his hands.</p>

<p>“Mister Norton!” he yelled. “Oscar slipped his collar and got away!”</p>

<p>“Just my luck!” exclaimed Norton, the florid one. “Here I bring this
bunch way up here to finish that film, and that blamed cat gets away and
spoils it all!”</p>

<p>“Oscar is uh cougar, I takes it,” opined Ren, rolling a cigarette and
looking admiringly at the girl. “I reckon somebody might as well let th’
lady loose. Cougars bein’ thick, I don’t think it’s safe to tie ladies
to trees anyway.”</p>

<p>One of the men cut the ropes which bound her, and the thin-faced man
recovered his camera from the willow thicket.</p>

<p>“Miss, I reckon you can have that cougar skin if yuh wants it,” remarked
Sig. “We ain’t got no use fer it, and if yuh wants it I’ll have Ren skin
it fer yuh.”</p>

<p>“I am Miss Reynolds,” she replied with a smile. “And I’d love to shake
hands with both of you. You gentlemen saved my life, and I haven’t words
to thank you with.”</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it, Miss Reynolds,” replied Sig. “Little thing like
that&mdash;why&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Slack up yore rope!” rasped Ren. “You never saved anything&mdash;not even
yore salary, and now yuh tells her that it’s uh little thing to save her
life.” He leaned over an’ held out his hand. “Miss Reynolds, I’m uh
heap glad to meet yuh. My name’s Ren Merton, and if there’s anything I
can do fer yuh&mdash;yuh can have that catskin to remember me by.”</p>

<p>She gave him a sweet smile.</p>

<p>“I’d love to have it, Mr. Merton. I’ll have one of the men skin it, and
every time I put my foot on that rug I’ll remember you. I’ve had my life
saved many times on the films, but this being the first time in real
life, I just don’t know what to say.”</p>

<p>“I jist hope yuh won’t forget it, anyway,” laughed Ren.</p>

<p>“Do you think you’ll forget it?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Lady,” interrupted Sig, “that hombre can forget anything. I’m th’
brains of our outfit, and if yuh wants an intelligent favor done, jist
ask me. <i>Sabe?</i>”</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether you gentlemen are in earnest or not. Do you mean
everything you say to each other?”</p>

<p>“I do,” replied Sig, with a bow, “but Mr. Merton here never meant
anything he ever said. He’s notorious fer jist talkin’. As I orates
before, Miss Reynolds, if there is anything I can do fer yuh, why&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I do wish we could get Oscar,” she replied reflectively. “There goes
poor old Nortie up the hill with a broken heart, and I know that Jack
Markham is awfully put out about it too. You see we’ve simply got to
have a cougar or we can’t finish the picture. I wonder if you could
catch Oscar? He’s as tame as a kitten and has never been wild. The
company raised him&mdash;got him from a zoo when he was a little yellow
kitten. I know that Mr. Norton would be willing to pay you well if you
would catch him.”</p>

<p>“Miss Reynolds, we ain’t mercenary thataway,” replied Sig. “I ain’t
wastin’ no love on that Norton person, and I don’t rassel no cougar fer
his money, but if you really wants that cat, I’m promisin’ it to yuh.”</p>

<p>“That’s awfully kind of you,” she cooed. “If you could catch him and
bring him back here tomorrow, I could just love you both. Then we could
finish that picture. Really, he is as tame as a kitten.”</p>

<p>“Consider him caught,” boasted Sig. “Me and Ren will bring him to yore
house tomorrow mawnin’. Uh course I could git him alone, but bein’ as
Ren is with me I’ll let him help.”</p>

<p>“Meanin’,” drawled Ren, “that I ropes that cat and ties him up fer
shipment, and Sig writes th’ address.”</p>

<p>Miss Reynolds insisted on shaking hands with both of them again, and her
smile left them both unable to roll a cigarette.</p>

<p>“We’re living in those cabins up there in the pines,” she explained,
“and probably will be there for a few days. You can bring him right up
there.”</p>

<p>“Yes’m,” they both replied, and watched her skip up the hill in the wake
of the rest of the party.</p>

<p>About half-way to the top she stopped and threw them a kiss, and then
danced out of sight in the jack-pines.</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>Ren rolled a fresh smoke and studied Sig’s rapt expression from under
his hat brim. Suddenly he broke into song&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“And that’s what made th’ wildcat wild.”</p>

<p>“Meanin’ which?” demanded Sig.</p>

<p>“Oscar,” chuckled Ren. “Don’t yuh see, Sig? Them velvet optics made
Oscar&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Listen,” snapped Sig. “Confine yore humor to somethin’ else. I don’t
sit here inactive and hear yuh slander them eyes none whatever. <i>Sabe</i>?
I’m backin’ th’ lady’s play&mdash;me.”</p>

<p>“Me and you both,” replied Ren seriously. “But did yuh ever stop to
consider that you gits so danged conceited when uh female person speaks
to yuh that yuh promises to do anything? Cougars ain’t woodchucks nor
snowshoe rabbits, and I’m thinkin’ aloud that you’ve gone plumb out of
yore class this time.”</p>

<p>“We’ll git him,” snapped Sig. “One of th’ fellers told me that th’ last
they saw of him he was lopin’ up th’ trail, and that means he’s liable
to hive up in our cabin. Bein’ as he’s uh house-bred animule, it stands
to reason that he’s goin’ to hunt human company soon’s he gits hungry or
gits scared of th’ dark. <i>Sabe?</i>”</p>

<p>Ren nodded and they turned their horses and rode on up the trail to
their cabin about two miles away. They unsaddled their horses at the
corral and then laid down on their bunks for a much-needed rest.</p>

<p>It was almost dark when Ren awoke and looked around the cabin. Sig was
gone. Ren got up and was lazily pulling on his boots when Sig came in
with a hammer in his hand and a smile on his face.</p>

<p>“Th’ sleek hare sleeps while th’ sly fox schemes,” he quoted
dramatically. “I reckon I’ve laid uh trap fer Oscar.”</p>

<p>He hung up the hammer and went out again. A few moments later he was
back of the cabin fumbling with the one window. “Help me take this thing
out, Ren!” he yelled.</p>

<p>Ren removed the nails from the inside and Sig removed the window and
threw in the end of his lariat rope.</p>

<p>“What’s th’ idea?” asked Ren.</p>

<p>Sig grinned and coiled up the rope.</p>

<p>“Cougar trap. I got this rope fixed so’s that when th’ cougar gits
inside of th’ shed, all we got to do is to pull on th’ rope and th’ door
shuts. There’s uh quarter uh venison in th’ shed and I’m bettin’ that
Oscar falls fer it, Ren. What do yuh think about it?”</p>

<p>“Sig, yore uh wonder! I’m bettin’ that you’ve already deduced how to tie
him up after we gits him inside. I shore honors and respects yuh, old
timer, and as uh special mark of respect I allows yuh to prepare our
evenin’ meal. I’m so hungry I could eat Oscar, I reckon.”</p>

<p>Three hours later they sat humped up on their bunk and watched the door
of the shed, a splotch of black in the half moonlight, and prayed that
the cougar would come before they lost too much sleep.</p>

<p>“Don’t light that cigarette here,” cautioned Ren. “Go back near th’
door. If that cat saw th’ light he’d never show up.”</p>

<p>Sig tiptoed to the front of the cabin and sat down on a box. Ren sat by
the window for a few minutes and then joined Sig.</p>

<p>“Give me yore papers and I’ll roll one, too. I reckon it’s uh little too
early fer Oscar to show up yet.”</p>

<p>They smoked in silence for a while and then sneaked back to the window.
Sig took one long look at the door and then threw himself backward and
heaved on the rope. The door shut with a bang and an unearthly yelp
split the stillness of the night.</p>

<p>“Got him!” whooped Sig. “I seen his eyes and slammed that old door right
in his face! Whoopee!”</p>

<p>“Good work!” exclaimed Ren. “I’ll bet Oscar is plumb scared to death
right now.”</p>

<p>“Not any he ain’t. Oscar’s uh tame cougar and, while he may display uh
little peevishness at first, he’ll be plumb satisfied with that hunk uh
meat. Let’s go out and see what he’s doin’.”</p>

<p>They walked around the shed but were unable to size up their catch, as
the shed had no windows. They could hear a sniffling at the cracks of
the door and suddenly a heavy body was flung against it, but the heavy
bar on the outside held it fast.</p>

<p>“Want to go inside and look him over?” queried Ren.</p>

<p>“Not in his present state uh mind, I don’t. That cat is shore some
irritated and when they gits fussed thataway they’re plumb informal. How
do yuh reckon we’re goin’ to acquire his carcass fer shipment?”</p>

<p>“Might git some uh that movie outfit to come up and git him,” suggested
Ren, but Sig promptly vetoed it.</p>

<p>“And have that beautiful lady think that me and you were afraid of her
pet, eh?”</p>

<p>“I’d rather be uh live coward than uh dead hero,” stated Ren. “There
ain’t no honor in th’ grave fer me. I got an idea though. Mebby she’s
good and mebby again she ain’t.”</p>

<p>“Shoot.”</p>

<p>“I’ll unfasten th’ door and let her open jist a little ways. <i>Sabe?</i> Th’
cat will try to come out and I’ll slam th’ door shut when he’s half-ways
out an’ all you has to do is to put two ropes on him. You take one and
I’ll take th’ other and Mr. Oscar is plumb helpless.”</p>

<p>“Uh ha,” agreed Sig. “That’s uh <i>hy-iu</i> scheme&mdash;if you holds him.”</p>

<p>“Aw &mdash;&mdash;, Sig, he’s tame! I’ll hold him. All you got to do is to slip
th’ two ropes on him and give me one. <i>Sabe?</i>”</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>Sig went to the corral and brought back two ropes. He held the nooses
handy while Ren removed the bar. He opened the door an inch at a time
and braced himself for the rush.</p>

<p>“Come on out, Oscar,” pleaded Sig. “Be uh nice li’l cat and come on&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Oscar came, not sneakingly nor slowly but a rasping, spitting, clawing
chunk of deviltry, and Ren shut the door just in time. It caught Oscar
at the flank and for a few seconds the air was full of cougar cuss
words.</p>

<p>Sig advanced cautiously and managed to get one rope over its head and
pulled the noose tight. He handed that rope to Ren, who immediately
proceeded to forget that he was there to keep the door tight. He grabbed
the rope with both hands, braced himself for the rush and unthinkingly
stepped away from the door.</p>

<p>There was a heave and a flash and the cougar sailed over Sig’s head and
out to the end of that rope. Ren was partly braced for the shock but
didn’t figure on the velocity of the animal, and when the shock came he
went straight up in the air and off across the clearing.</p>

<p>Luckily he lit running and hung on to the rope, and he and the cougar
went down the hill, over stumps and through the thickets like a
spitting, yelling, yellow comet with a human tail.</p>

<p>They had traveled thus for about two hundred yards when the cougar went
on one side of a tree and Ren on the other. They almost met on the big
swing. The cat flipped upside down over a log while Ren almost completed
the circle, only stopping when he threw his arms around a tree and hung
on. He still held the rope and had presence of mind enough left to
proceed to tie that cat up good and tight. The cougar had choked itself
nearly to death trying to come up under the log and Ren had little
trouble in tying its hind legs so it was helpless.</p>

<p>He rolled a smoke and hobbled back to the cabin. He wondered in a
detached sort of way what had become of Sig and why he didn’t help him
hold it, but as he walked around the cabin he heard Sig’s voice
imploring him to:</p>

<p>“Hurry up, fer Gawd’s sake!”</p>

<p>“What’s th’ matter?” asked Ren.</p>

<p>“Come over here you danged fool!” wailed Sig. “Can’t yuh see I can’t
hold this door much longer!”</p>

<p>“Hold th&mdash;what&mdash;why, I’ll be danged! Where did yuh git it, Sig?”</p>

<p>“Grab hold uh this door! How do I know where I got it? When you and
Oscar paraded off down th’ hill I sees uh pair uh eyes shinin’ in there
and I jist slams th’ door in time to catch his neck. Gosh, ain’t he a
sassy-lookin’ animule, Ren? Where’s Oscar?”</p>

<p>“Hog-tied to uh log,” mumbled Ren. “At least I got uh cougar tied to th’
log&mdash;I didn’t ask his name. I wonder how two of ’em got in at oncet, and
which is Oscar?”</p>

<p>“This ain’t Oscar,” stated Sig with conviction. “No house variety of
cougar would have uh face and uh disposition like this one, Ren.”</p>

<p>“Hang onto th’ door, Sig, while I takes uh board off th’ wall and
attacks him from behind. You jist keep on squeezin’ him and I’ll tie him
up.”</p>

<p>Ren got the hammer and removed a board. The cougar objected at the top
of its voice, but in a few minutes Ren had it trussed up and tied off to
a rafter.</p>

<p>They went into the cabin, boiled a pot of coffee and had a smoke.</p>

<p>“Well, we don’t know which is Oscar, but I reckon Miss Reynolds can pick
him out,” remarked Ren.</p>

<p>“Said she’d love me if I got him,” grinned Sid, “and I’ve got him.”</p>

<p>“Yore hearin’ is on uh par with yore brains,” drawled Ren. “She said
‘us,’ and what’s more, Siggie, you ain’t got him&mdash;I’ve got him. <i>Sabe?</i>
I risked my whole danged life to git her that cougar. You can put yore
location notice on that one in th’ shed, but not on Oscar. He’s mine,
located, filed and patented.”</p>

<p>“Is that so!” exploded Sig. “I’m here to orate that it was my scheme
which caught it! All you did was to hang on to th’ rope and, not bein’
overly strong nor active, you permits that li’l cat to haul yuh around,
regardless. And now yuh opines that yuh owns Oscar. Not any yuh don’t!</p>

<p>“I don’t care if yuh did tear yore pants,” he continued. “If yuh can’t
take care of yoreself don’t blame me. I’ve shore treated yuh white, Ren
Merton, and now yuh turns and bites th’ hand which feeds yuh!”</p>

<p>“Bites yore hand!” snorted Ren, shaking his forefinger under Sig’s nose.
“Listen: any time I starts bitin’ you won’t confine yore diagnosis to
hands, old timer. I orates openly that as soon as daylight comes I’m
goin’ down and make uh crate and prepare Oscar fer shipment. <i>Sabe?</i> I
ain’t concernin’ myself about that cat in th’ shed and hereby waives all
rights to him, but I duly informs all present company that I’m uh close
corporation when it comes to li’l’ Oscar. Let’s go to bed.”</p>

<p>“Not with you!” snarled Sig. “I’ll take uh blanket and go out in th’
woods or sleep in th’ shed with th’ cougar. I hereby refuses to share
yore bed and I does it without malice in m’ heart. You grieves me
deeply, Mr. Merton, and I’m sore at heart and meek-feelin’.”</p>

<p>“Hop to it!” grunted Ren, as he rolled into the bunk and stretched
wearily. “Don’t go near Oscar ’cause I reckon he’s fond uh meek things.”</p>

<p>Sig took a blanket and went out, closing the door softly. As the door
closed, Ren slid out of his bunk and peered out of the window. He
chuckled as he saw Sig wander off into the trees, and he sat up and
rolled a smoke and seemed to ponder deeply. Suddenly he slapped his leg
and pinched out the light of his cigarette.</p>

<p>“By golly!” he chuckled, “won’t Sig go high, wide and handsome?”</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>The first tinge of morning showed in the east when Ren slipped out of
the cabin and approached the shed. Ten minutes later a tawny figure
glided out of the open shed and bounded off into the underbrush. Five
minutes later an apparition in rags stumbled out of the shed and leaned
uncertainly against the wall.</p>

<p>“Mama mine!” it mumbled. “I must be uh sight. Them danged things won’t
go away when yuh gives ’em uh chance. I shore am scratched some
artistic.”</p>

<p>He staggered into the cabin and painfully removed his torn clothing. He
tore up some of the shirt for bandages, but there was too much space to
cover and he was awfully tired. He sat on the bunk as naked as the day
he was born and fumbled for a cigarette in the pockets he didn’t have
on.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be teetotally &mdash;&mdash;!” exclaimed Sig’s voice from the doorway
but Ren never looked up. “Come on and help me, Sig. I reckon I’m all cut
to shoestrings.”</p>

<p>“You ain’t alone, Ren.”</p>

<p>Ren lifted his head and looked at Sig.</p>

<p>“Pickled prairie-dogs!” he groaned. “What happened to you? Did
you&mdash;huh&mdash;turn Oscar loose?”</p>

<p>“After seven years uh hard fightin’ and hardships I manages to break his
holt,” declared Sig dismally. “I’m jist uh walkin’ hunk uh Hamburger
steak, Ren, and I feels that when I removes my clothes I’ll be no more.
That cat jist simply prospected every piece uh meat on my frame. In my
war-sack under th’ bunk there’s uh roll uh stickin’ plaster. You wrap me
up and I’ll do th’ same fer you, Ren. I’ve done played my last
joke&mdash;absolutely. I suppose th’ shed is empty?”</p>

<p>“Uh ha,” nodded Ren. “I’m apologizin’, Sig.”</p>

<p>“Aw, Ren, I reckon misery likes company.”</p>

<p>“Well,” drawled Ren, “she’s got it.”</p>

<p>Half an hour later, with adhesive plaster covering most of their bodies
they laid down on the bunk and rolled more cigarettes.</p>

<p>“I wonder which one was Oscar?” mused Sig aloud, but Ren was deep in
thought and made no answer.</p>

<p>Finally Ren drew a deep breath and turned to Sig.</p>

<p>“Them movie people take big chances, don’t they? Jist think about uh
girl playin’ with Oscar. Tame? Say, I shore hope I never meets uh wild
cougar, Sig. That animule shore put his trade-mark on me.”</p>

<p>Just then there came a clatter of horse’s hoofs outside and Sig limped
over to the closed door.</p>

<p>“Hello!” yelled a voice, which they both recognized as that of Norton,
the movie director.</p>

<p>“Hello, yoreself!” retorted Sig. “We’re takin’ our mornin’ bath and
can’t come out.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” laughed Norton. “I just came up here to deliver a
message to you from Miss Reynolds.”</p>

<p>“What was it?” asked Sig quickly.</p>

<p>“She said for you boys not to worry about Oscar because he came back
right after you left.”</p>

<p>“Must be sore about something,” reflected Norton as his horse picked
its way down the narrow trail. “Either they are sore or mighty
ungentlemanly, because they never even said ‘thank you.’”</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use

copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
